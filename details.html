            founded in 2013, is a freight forwarding and customs brokerage company based in San Francisco, California. They are on a mission to foster free trade across the world through technology.

            Their full-service logistics platform uses state-of-the-art software to fix the user experience in global trade. The freight service includes an online dashboard for businesses to easily understand, purchase, manage, and track the services required for global trade.

            In the present day, no online process is complete without a robust customer support team — and effective email management is a crucial part of this endeavor at Flexport.

        <h1 >The Challenge</h1>
        <h3>
            Nathan Strang, the Ocean Freight Operations Manager, and his team handle inquiries from shipping companies that use Flexport. A majority of these emails are questions related to the online dashboard. His team receives around 1000 customer emails a month — which are then assigned to team members based on the ocean shipping line involved.
             <br>
             The team was using Gmail’s filters to manage their workflow. When a team member had to assign an email to someone, s/he would either forward it or share the subject line with them on Slack. Because neither was an unerring way to establish ownership, there were frequent email misses — and customers were left waiting for a reply.
            <br>
            Nathan wanted to be on top of his team’s workflow, but he couldn’t. Knowing what happened to emails was not straightforward. He would have to spend time finding out who was working on the email — and then ask them what happened to it.
        </h3>
        <h1>
            “We were missing a lot of emails. I had no way of monitoring the workflow. I didn’t know how long we were taking to reply to emails”, Nathan says. 
        </h1>
        <h3>
            The team members had a difficult time collaborating on customer emails. When someone needed help resolving a query, they had to forward the entire email thread. Or they would take things to Slack — building the context there was time-consuming.
            <br>
            Because of all the forwarding and internal email exchanges among teammates, email threads were becoming messy. Revisiting emails to gather information was becoming difficult. Customer service was slowing down
